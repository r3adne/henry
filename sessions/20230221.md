## Daily goal
1. get an understanding of where Henry is in each focus area (as well as math background)
2. set up a cpp development environment (vs code, cmake, make, xcode tools)
3. set up git
4. introduce cs fundamentals

## 1. understand where we're starting from
These questions aren't meant to be all things you'll understand. Rather, noticing your responses to all of these help me understand what would be redundant for you, and what you need to build more understanding of.

cs/cpp/juce
- What is your programming background in general? 
	- Have you taken any classes? C class in HS (APCS in C++), Analog electronics, Python ML edx
	- What languages, systems, and tools have you used? VB, lua, some JS
	- What goals have you tried to achieve and/or what projects have you worked on? making malware, ctrlr panels, js stuff
- What do you understand about logical operators? using truth tables, strings of logical ops, etc.
- What do you understand about conditionals? if... else if... else.
- What is a function? like a subroutine, executing a chunk of code.
- What do you know about c/cpp types such as `bool`, `int`, `float`, `double`, `unsigned int`, etc? yep.
- Do you have any experience with Object Oriented Programming/what is a class? structures of user-defined modules you can call, 
- What do you understand about pointers? yes
- What do you understand about references? more or less. 
- What do you understand about algorithms and data structures? algorithm: set of instructions, ds: a format of data... 
- What is the difference between stack and heap memory? no.  
- What do you know about algorithmic analysis for time and memory complexity? basic big O concepts
- What do you understand about threads and concurrency? no.
- What is a computer architecture/instruction set? no. 
- What is a compiler? yep.
- Is there anything relevant I didn't cover?  max, pd, sc, creative coding, ruby, some embedded
audio
- What background do you have with audio processing? lots. analog audio mod, pll,  
- Are you aware of basic properties of digital audio, such as bit depth and sampling rate? yes.
- What is the nyquist frequency? yep.
- What is the difference between online and offline audio processing? realtime vs nonrealtime
- What is the difference between continuous- and discrete-time signals? yep.
- What is the fourier transform (FFT)? mostly 
- What is a Linear system? What is a Time-Invariant System (a.k.a. do you know what LTI systems are)? 
$$ F(x(t)) + F(y(t)) = F(x(t)+y(t))$$ 
- What is convolution? yep.
- What is a filter? What is the difference between FIR and IIR filters? blocks out certain frequencies by a given gain for each frequency. 
- What is a circular buffer? yep. 
- Is there anything relevant I didn't cover? 


## 2. set up a cpp development environment
You may already have some of these tools installed. If not, we need to get

- XCode and command line tools (incl. make)
- CMake
- Obsidian, if you wish to read and understand these notes. 



## 3. set up git, learn git basics



## 4. introduce cs fundamentals
