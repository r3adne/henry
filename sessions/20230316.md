## Introduce C++ Inheritance

### user-defined types
C++ allows the user (programmer) to create *types* which are ultimately the way most C++ programming is done in the modern era.  

#### in C

##### Structs
The C Programming language allowed users to define types such as `struct`s, but they worked quite a bit differently than C++ structures do (C structures will be referred to as "C structs", and C++ structs will be referred to as "structs"). C structs allow the combination and grouping of members which may be later initialized in a group. Members are stored sequentially in memory for each instance of the struct.

##### Enums
C provided `enum` types, which are user-defined types which are stored as values of the underlying type. These are relatively similar in C++.

##### Unions
Unions are like structs, but whose members are stored with the same starting bit in memory. This is rarely practically useful, and is often misused for implementing nefarious (undefined) behaviors.

##### Typedef 
Typedefs are the most common C method for using type aliasing, which allows the user to describe a shorthand for an specific other type. This is similar in C++.

#### in C++

##### Classes and Structs
C++ introuces the user-defined type of `class`.  Classes are somewhat like structs, but rather than having exclusively members of types, classes may have members of various types:

- **data members** are just like C struct members - they are instances of types 
- **function members** are functions that exist in the scope of the class itself. 
- **nested types** are types that are defined as subclasses of the class, and are used within the namespace of the class.

Members can be defined with three member access specifiers: `private`, `protected`, and `public`. Private members may only be used within the class, public members may be accessed (and modified, if non-const) from anywhere, and protected members may only be used by members of the class, or by friends of the class, or to members of a child class, under certain conditions (which we can get into later).

In C++, `class` and `struct` mean the same thing, but structs initially have public member access and classes initially have private. Either can be modified by use of `private`, `protected`, or `public` keywords. 

##### Inheritance
Classes and structs also have inheritance in C++, which is a common factor of many Object-Oriented languages. 

Inheritance allows us to define a class with optional base (parent) classes. In C++, we use this form in the class declaration to describe the parent-child relationship between two classes:

```
class Child : public Parent;
```

where `public` is the access specifier for the parent class. Much like for members of a class, access specifiers are able to modify the behavior of a child class relative to its parents. For `public` base classes, `public` and `protected` members of the base class keep their access type, and the base class's `private` members are inaccessible to the child class. For `protected` base classes, `public` and `protected` members of the base class are `protected` to the base class, and `private` members are inaccessible. For `private` base classes, `public`, `protected`, and `private` classes are all `private` to the base class. This is better visualized like this:

| inheritance type | base public | base protected | base private |
|------------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| public           | public      | protected      | inaccessible |
| protected        | protected   | protected      | inaccessible |
| private          | private     | private        | inaccessible |

This is especially important in situations where there are multiple layers of inheritance, but most simpler applications use public inheritance. 

Inheritance like this begs two questions:
1. is there a way that a child class can modify the behavior of its parents (virtual functions), and
2. what are the rules for when a child has two parents (multiple inheritance)?

##### Virtual Functions
Virtual functions are functions which are able to be modified by child functions. They are broken up into two different types:
1. **pure virtual functions**, which are not implemented at all in the parent class, and where the implementation is left entirely to the child class. A pure virtual function is declared with the syntax `virtual int F() = 0`. 
2. **virtual functions**, which are implemented in the parent class but allowed to be modified by the child class using **function overriding**. 

In C++, a virtual function of a parent class can be overriden by a child class with the `override` keyword.

A class with at least one pure virtual function is called an **Abstract** class, and cannot be instantiated into an object directly. 

##### Multiple Inheritance
Multiple inheritance is the concept wherein multiple parent classes are inherited by a single child class. This is rather controversial, but it is widely used in C++.

For example, we might see a class `Cat` which has base classes `Pet` and `Mammal`. `Pet` and `Mammal` might have different data and interfaces. For instance, `Pet` might have `int microchip_id`, and/or function `int get_microchip_id()` which returns the microchip ID of the pet. Meanwhile, `Mammal` might have information about the mammal's hair growth pattern or diet, perhaps `std::vector<String> getDietOptions()`. The child class `Cat` would be able to call any of these functions. 


###### The Diamond Problem 
A potential issue may arise when dealing with virtual functions, often called the Diamond Problem. The diamond problem is an edge case of multiple inheritance that involves four classes, we'll call them A, B, C, and D. 

`A` is a class which has a member function `A::F()`. `B` and `C` are both child classes of `A`, which each override `A::F()` separately.  `D` is a child of both classes `B` and `C`. If the user calls `D::F()`, which overriden version of `A::F()` should be called? 

Different programming languages solve this problem differently, and some use this sort of issue to justify removing multiple inheritance altogether. In C++, under these circumstances, we need to clarify which overriden version we are using inside of `D`. Specifcally, if we wanted to call the override specified in `B`, we would call `B::F()`. This is because, internally, C++ classes with multiple unique paths to a single base class contain multiple base instances inside them, meaning that the language is otherwise unable to tell to which `F` the user is referring. This is great for readability, but if the classes are large and/or many instances of the class are needed, we might prefer to use **virtual inheritance**, which ensures that only one such copy of the grandparent class is needed. 

In C++, we can put `virtual` alongside (on either side) of the member access specifier, which allows us to resolve some of these issues without needing to explicitly refer to `B::F()` or `C::F()` in the above example. If we declare `B` and `D` using:

``` 
class B : virtual public A; 
// and
class D : virtual public B, public C;
```

We would be able to use member functions of `A`, including the function `F` overriden by `B`, without specifying `B::F()` (i.e. by just calling `F()`). We could still use the version of `F` overriden by C with `C::F()`. 

#### Why do we bother with OOP?

As you can see above, OOP can be pretty tricky and can have a lot of edge cases. The benefits to it are clear, though. It encourages us to use the following helpful tools, which ends up allowing us to reuse code more, make changes to codebases more easily, and get an intuitive sense of our solutions.

- encapsulation (separating the interface from the implementation)
- inheritance (allows us to create something resembling a real-world relationship)
- polymorphism (the ability of different types to share the same interface)


## Practice problem 1

Let's play around with C++ objects to solve a problem: 

	Write a C++ class that represents an (single channel) audio processor. What members should it have? Create a child of this class which is a trivial filter that averages the current sample and the previous sample.
