### C++
C++ is a high-level, compiled, object-oriented programming langauge which is based on the C Programming Language.

Like C, it uses a `int main()` function to describe the entry point of a program, although this is often abstracted from practical usage by a library such as JUCE or QT. Still, it is necessary to understand that the return value of the `main` function is usually used to show under what conditions the program finished. A return value of `0` is used to show that the program has completed successfully, and any other value indicates that the program has failed or been terminated. 

C++ programs consist of a set of ordered statements, which are, without loss of generality, executed in order, top to bottom and then left to right. In general, lines are separated by semicolons `;`, and sometimes semicolons are used to separate sub-statements within a single statement (see: `for` and compound statements). Statements availible in C++ are:

- **expression statements** are sequences of operators and operands. for instance, `(a + b) != c`, `function_name(12, true, true);`, `(&a != nullptr ? "null" : "non-null")`, `new std::array<int, 24>();`, `static_cast<int>(bool_value)`. Most statements in C++ programs are these. 
- **declaration statements** are statements that introduce names to the program. For instance, `const char* k;`, `auto* l`, `struct name`, `namespace tmp`, `template <typename T, int N> struct s`. 
- **selection statements** are `if`, `else if`,  `else`, and `switch` statements, which are used to conditionally select which (if any) block to execute. 
- **iteration statements** are `for`,  `while`, `range for`,   and (rarely) `do...while` statements, which loop the contained code based on the rules of looping.
- **compound statements** are sequences of other statements that are executed in blocks. This allows us to use multiple statements in a place where one statement is expected. For instance, the contents of a set of curly brackets `{}` after a selection or iteration statement.
- **jump statements** are transfers of control flow. For instance, `return` leaves the current function and optionally returns a value to the caller. Also, `break` and `continue` allow us to manipulate the execution of loops. `goto` is a rarely used jump statement that goes to a specific labeled location directly (if you're using it, you're probably doing something wrong).
- **labeled statements**, which are used either for `case` and `default` statements in a `switch` statement, or for use with `goto`. 
- **try blocks** which allow us to try to perform an action and handle an exception gracefully. Often, other means of exception handling are used in practice, and try blocks tend to be unutilized in many codebases. 
- **atomic and synchronized blocks (TM TS)**, which we won't get into, as they are not yet part of the C++ standard and are not necessary under normal conditions which we will assume (although concurrency and synchronization are quite interesting areas in general and we will explore some classical problems and solutions within that area.)

We can formally break down any C++ program into a set of these statements, but a practical understanding of a C++ program comes down to a more nuanced understanding of certain areas from a less formal lens. 

### Variables and Objects in C++
Like many programming languages, C++ allows us to create variables. Variables have names and (normally) store values. In C++ and similar languages, variables also have a specific type unlike, for instance, python, where a variable can change type dynamically. Fittingly, this property of C++ is called strong-typing or static-typing, where the type system provided in python is called weak- or dynamic-typing. 

We can create a variable using a **declaration statement**. 

`int x;`

This tells the compiler that we wish to use an integer named x. These sorts of statements consist of:

`<typename> <variable-name>;` 

We can optionally provide a value to that initial variable with a `=` followed by an expression statement:

`int x = 12` 

or 

`int x = 12 + get_start_value();`

A lot of C++ is conducted in these sorts of statements, although often the types and the expressions involved are more complex.

A crucial thing to understand is that a type, variable, and an object are different. A type is an attribute that all objects have, and an object is a particular instance of a type in a block of memory. Not all types even represent a block of memory at all (such as references).

There are various sorts of types in C++, from simple, built-in types like `int` or `double` to complex templates like `std::array<typename T, int N>`. They are discussed in the next section. 

## 2. Introduce C++ OOP concepts

### types
A type is a property that objects, references, functions, and expressions have, which a) restricts the ways the user can interact with it, and b) indicates how the compiler should interpret the otherwise meaningless set of bits that make it up. 

Often, types represent semantically meaningful things. For instance, a `std::duration` represents a difference between two times (semantically, duration of time), and a `bool` represents a value of either `true` or `false` (semantically, the evaluation of a logical statement). Other times, types are just used because they are the paradigm around which C++ is based, and may lack semantic meaning.

C++ provides many types that are commonly used, a complete list of which can be found [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/type). As C++ is an old and rather sprawling language, there are many types in this list that are mostly maintained for backwards compatibility, and aren't likely to be useful to learn. 

### user-defined types
C++ allows the user (programmer) to create *types* which are ultimately the way most C++ programming is done in the modern era.  

#### in C

##### Structs
The C Programming language allowed users to define types such as `struct`s, but they worked quite a bit differently than C++ structures do (C structures will be referred to as "C structs", and C++ structs will be referred to as "structs"). C structs allow the combination and grouping of members which may be later initialized in a group. Members are stored sequentially in memory for each instance of the struct.

##### Enums
C provided `enum` types, which are user-defined types which are stored as values of the underlying type. These are relatively similar in C++.

##### Unions
Unions are like structs, but whose members are stored with the same starting bit in memory. This is rarely practically useful, and is often misused for implementing nefarious (undefined) behaviors.

##### Typedef 
Typedefs are the most common C method for using type aliasing, which allows the user to describe a shorthand for an specific other type. This is similar in C++.

#### in C++

##### Classes and Structs
C++ introuces the user-defined type of `class`.  Classes are somewhat like structs, but rather than having exclusively members of types, classes may have members of various types:

- **data members** are just like C struct members - they are instances of types 
- **function members** are functions that exist in the scope of the class itself. 
- **nested types** are types that are defined as subclasses of the class, and are used within the namespace of the class.

Members can be defined with three member access specifiers: `private`, `protected`, and `public`. Private members may only be used within the class, public members may be accessed (and modified, if non-const) from anywhere, and protected members may only be used by members of the class, or by friends of the class, or to members of a child class, under certain conditions (which we can get into later).

In C++, `class` and `struct` mean the same thing, but structs initially have public member access and classes initially have private. Either can be modified by use of `private`, `protected`, or `public` keywords. 

##### Inheritance
Classes and structs also have inheritance in C++, which is a common factor of many Object-Oriented languages. 

We will get into inheritance in more detail later, and using more practical examples. 

Let's play around with C++ objects to solve a problem: 

	Write a C++ class that represents an (single channel) audio processor. What members should it have? Create a child of this class which is a trivial lowpass filter that averages the current sample and the previous sample.
